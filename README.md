Welcome to the psidex, a json-based system for python script distribution!
The idea for this came from ywangd’s [proof of concept](https://github.com/ywangd/Pythonista-Script-Index),
and I decided to try my hand at making a polished, fully working and scalable version.
The package manager used would be psiman (formerly [spkg](https://github.com/sn3ksoftware/sandpkg/tree/testing)), a Python rewrite of the original package manager.
More to come here soon (this is wip for now)
